I wish to build a lab which looks for highly motivated students that enjoy working closely with me and appreciate uncompromising intensity in their pursuit for success.
It is important to me that lab group I build is not just built from the best
people but also people who have non-traditional backgrounds who might have been
overlooked elsewhere, and or identify with underrepresented backgrounds. The
collective diversity of the lab is a key pillar to conduct truly innovative
research that has the potential to not just challenge but redefine the status
quo.

If you're still here and interested please read more below to find out whether we can be the right fit for each other and have a look the [application process](/phd-positions/).

## How do I envision the Phd supervision to happen?

My research supervision style is best characterized as working in a small
startup environment where instead of reaching shipping velocity for products we care about (uncompromisingly) scientific excellence. This also means that I envision a mostly flat hierarchy where
you are free bring your own exciting ideas, openly challenge my own ideas that
I give you, and also respectfully mold your collaborative ideas with lab
members.

Operationally, this will result in me being very actively involved in all of our research
projects together. In a typical research project life cycle this could involve
a subset of the following: providing support with own research ideas, helping you debug your code,
writing your papers, as well helping you prove your main results. As you become
more senior, my supervision style is intentional in letting you breathe and
develop into your own independent researcher, with in the final stages me
providing only minimal support. As a result, a successful Phd graduate under my
supervision should be able to easily define their own research problems, set
appropriate research hypotheses/goals, test them and also present their
findings to the highest scientific standards.

I expect the Phd journey to be intense, but beautifully rewarding because we
are working towards **ambituous scientific goals** in collaboration with the
best people in the academic world. The closest analagy is working in an elite
sports team where each player is a superstar and on any given day take over and
"win the game" for the team.

In some sense, my expectations for a successful Phd will go beyond the minimum
requirements to graduate. My dream is to help you become the best in the world in your
chosen area of interest, and enable you execute with confidence your bold research visions by the time you graduate.
If this speaks to you and you enjoy being in a competitive yet highly
nurturing/supportive environment then we are likely to work well together, with
me being the rocket fuel for your space ship to the moon and beyond.

## Benefits of working with a new faculty
As one of my first students you have the unique opportunity to have a big voice
in the shape and direction in the budding lab. This environment will allow you
to---if you want to---help recruit future lab members, shape the lab culture
including reading groups, lab socials, and also establish best practices.

In addition, I will be significantly involved in your Phd, providing ample
hands on supervision on a daily basis---something that is harder and harder to
find in the current ML landscape. I will also be giving some of my best ideas
that I think are the most interesting to pursue together. We will also work closely
as collaborators rather than have a hierarchy between a traditional senior
research manager and their reports.

Finally, I will also be actively looking out for the best opportunities for
your career development beyond the immediate lab. This could lead to potential
future research internships---with many people in famous big tech labs only an
email away from me---or academic visits at other universities. My goal here is
to empower you with options so that you can make the best decisions both about
your budding research interests as well as your larger research career
**whereever it takes you**.

## Potential Drawbacks of working with a new faculty
There are, of course, certain pitfalls of working with a new faculty. Having
been the first student of my former Phd advisor I feel I can empathize greatly
with some of these experiences. The most obvious one, is that we will not
immediately be a "famous lab", and thus some opportunities (e.g. your dream
Research scientist/post-doc position) may not be as easily guaranteed. Also,
there are expected hiccups along the road, mostly due to me figuring things out
and screwing up and inadvertently transmitting the ramifications of these
errors to you. In addition, at the beginning the lab will be a small and tight
group which has the benefits of everyone being deeply knowledgeable about each
others research while also being limited by the diversity of other cool
research outside of our immediate lab.
