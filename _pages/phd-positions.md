I am starting as an Assistant Professor of Computing at Imperial College London in January 2026. I am looking for highly motivated PhD students to join my group working on generative modelling, differentional geometry for machine learning, and AI4Science applications. If you're interested in working with me, please send your CV and a brief description of your research interests to my email. This last step can be done via the Expression of Interest Form below as well.

As research is quite challenging, with my lab I will be aiming to pursue the
most challenging scientific questions of our time that are unlocked through AI
based solutions. Consequently, the Bose lab in particular welcomes applications
from students with non-traditional backgrounds, underrepresented groups, and
other diverse groups that go beyond simply mainstream ML. Please see my
[supervision style](/supervision-style/) for a better overview to determine if you're as enthusiastic
about me as I'm likely about you (and your future sucess).


## Application Process

Imperial is quite rigid in that students who wish to apply to a supervisor have to first apply to the department of computing and pass the screening process there. Please also mention my name in the formal applicaiton to Imperial. Please see the link on the web page for more information: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/phd/

As funding is a bit more tricky in the UK I also highly recommend applying for a PhD scholarships. The link below has a list of scholarships, where the first set are department scholarships and the remaining set are prof specific ones. Please consider applying to the [department ones as a first priority.](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/courses/phd/scholarships/)

Finally, you can also apply to a center for doctoral studies to fund your PhD. This is a separate application but the benefit is that your degree is funded automatically for 4 years and they give you additional funding for travel etc ... The department of computing suggests you apply to the [AI for Health care CDT](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/scholarships-search/ukri-ai-for-healthcare-cdt-studentship-20252026.php)

However, other CDT's are also possible and have their own application processes.

Finally, please also don't forget to fill out this informal Expression of
Interest form just to make sure I don't miss your application when you submit it.
