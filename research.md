My current research interests are primarily in Adversarial Machine Learning
applied to different domains such as Images, Text and most recently Graphs.
Specifically, I'm interested in all things related to GAN's, adversarial attacks and adversarial
disentanglement. More broadly, I'm interested in understanding how to build
better machine learning models that can operate in the world around us and
serve humans better. This entails understanding the data generative process,
the biases that are reflected within the data and most importantly
understanding how these models fail.
