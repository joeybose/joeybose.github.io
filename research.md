My current research interests are primarily in Adversarial Machine Learning.
Specifically, I'm interested in interpreting and improving contrastive learning techniques such as metric
learning, triplet loss, and noise contrastive estimation through an adversarial
lens. I'm also very interested in crafting and gaining a deeper understanding
of Adversarial Attacks and their transferability properties. My long term
research goal is to create artificial agents that can parse the world and
interact with it as humans do. The nature of knowledge, computational
curiosity, and the general Reinforcement Learning framework are areas that I'm
looking to actively pursue as future research directions.
