I'm a PhD student at the RLLab at McGill/MILA where I work on Adversarial
Machine Learning on Graphs. Previously, I was a Master's student at the University of Toronto where I researched
crafting Adversarial Attacks on Computer Vision models using GAN's. I
also interned at Borealis AI where I was working on applying adversarial
learning principles to learn better embeddings i.e. Word Embeddings for Machine
Learning models.
