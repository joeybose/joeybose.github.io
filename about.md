I'm a Master's student at the University of Toronto where I'm researching
crafting Adversarial Attacks on Computer Vision models using GAN's. I'm
also a research intern at Borealis AI where I'm working on applying adversarial
learning principles to learn better embeddings i.e. Word Embeddings for Machine
Learning models.
